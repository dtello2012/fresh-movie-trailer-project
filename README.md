# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Project
The project was written with server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. The code is then served as a web page allowing visitors to view my favorite movies and watch the trailers. 

This project was written in Python 2.7.x
