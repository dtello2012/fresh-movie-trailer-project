# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Project
The project was written with server-side code to store a list of **my favorite movies**, including _box art imagery_ and a _movie trailer URL_. The _code_ is then served as a web page allowing visitors to view my favorite movies and watch the trailers.

This project was written in **Python 2.7.x**
